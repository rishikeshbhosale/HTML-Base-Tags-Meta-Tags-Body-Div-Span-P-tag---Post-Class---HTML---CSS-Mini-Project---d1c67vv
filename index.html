                <p>The Giza pyramid complex, also called the Giza necropolis, is the site on the Giza Plateau in Greater
                    Cairo, Egypt that includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of
                    Menkaure, along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx of Giza. All were built
                    during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, between 2600 and 2500 BC. The site
                    also includes several cemeteries and the remains of a workers' village.</p><br><br>

                <h3>2. Great Wall of China</h3>
                <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern
                    borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups
                    from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with
                    selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.
                    Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple
                    stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty
                    (1368–1644). </p><br><br>

                <h3>3. Petra </h3>
                <p>Petra , originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō is a historic and archaeological city
                    in southern Jordan. It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by
                    mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of
                    Aqaba. The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might
                    have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.
                    Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second
                    century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital.</p><br><br>

                <h3>4. Colosseum</h3>
                <p>The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the
                    Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
                    amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian and
                    was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were
                    made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96). The three emperors that were patrons of the work are
                    known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later
                    classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name. </p><br><br>

                <p>Chichen Itza was one of the largest Maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical
                    great cities, or Tollans, referred to in later Mesoamerican literature. The city may have had the
                    most diverse population in the Maya world, a factor that could have contributed to the variety of
                    architectural styles at the site.</p><br><br>

                <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a
                    2,430-meter (7,970 ft) mountain ridge. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba
                    Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba
                    River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a tropical mountain
                    climate.</p><br><br>

                <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian
                    city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house
                    the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The
                    tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
                    house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. </p><br><br>
